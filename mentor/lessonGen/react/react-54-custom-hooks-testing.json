      "mentorSays": "Let's understand what this Custom Hooks Testing challenge asks for.\n\n**The Challenge:**\n// Create a React component for: Custom Hooks Testing\n// Use functional component syntax\n// Export the component\n\n**What We're Building:**\nThis challenge tests your understanding of Hook testing, test utilities. You'll need to create a React component that demonstrates these concepts effectively.\n\n**Why This Matters:**\n\nCustom Hooks Testing is a fundamental React concept that you'll use in every application. Understanding this is essential for:\n- Building interactive React applications\n- Following React best practices\n- Writing maintainable, scalable code\n- Passing technical interviews\n- Working effectively in React teams\n\n**Real-World Applications:**\n- Used in production React applications at companies like Facebook, Netflix, Airbnb, Instagram\n- Common pattern in modern web development\n- Essential for building scalable, maintainable UIs\n- Industry-standard approach that every React developer must know\n- Foundation for more advanced React patterns\n\n**Conceptual Foundation:**\n\nUNDERSTANDING CUSTOM HOOKS TESTING:\n\nThis concept is fundamental to React development. It enables you to build interactive, dynamic user interfaces that respond to user actions and data changes.\n\n**Key Concepts:**\n- Core React pattern used in production applications\n- Essential for building modern web applications\n- Follows React best practices and conventions\n- Industry-standard approach used by major companies\n\n**How It Works:**\n\nThe solution involves understanding React's component model, state management, and how to implement this specific pattern effectively. This pattern is used extensively in real-world React applications.\n\n**Step-by-Step Example:**\n\nLet's build a Custom Hooks Testing component step by step:\n\n**Step 1: Set up the component structure**\n```javascript\nimport React from 'react';\n\nfunction customhookstesting() {\n  // Component logic will go here\n}\n```\n\n**Step 2: Add the core functionality**\nBased on the challenge requirements, we'll implement the main feature.\n\n**Step 3: Add enhancements and edge case handling**\nWe'll add proper error handling and edge cases.\n\n**Step 4: Export and use the component**\n```javascript\nexport default customhookstesting;\n```\n\n**Pattern Variations:**\n\n**PATTERN 1: Basic Implementation**\n\nThe simplest approach that solves the core requirement. Easy to understand and implement.\n\n**PATTERN 2: Enhanced Implementation**\n\nAdds error handling, edge cases, and better user experience. Production-ready code.\n\n**PATTERN 3: Advanced Implementation**\n\nIncludes performance optimizations, advanced React patterns, and scalability considerations.\n\n**Which Pattern to Use:**\n\n- **Pattern 1**: Simple use cases, learning, quick prototypes\n- **Pattern 2**: Most common scenarios, production-ready code\n- **Pattern 3**: Complex requirements, performance-critical applications\n\n**Best Practices:**\n\n**Best Practices:**\n\n1. **Follow React Conventions**\n   - Use functional components (modern React)\n   - Follow naming conventions (PascalCase for components)\n   - Keep components focused and single-purpose\n\n2. **Code Organization**\n   - One component per file\n   - Clear, descriptive names\n   - Proper file structure and imports\n\n3. **Performance Considerations**\n   - Optimize re-renders when needed\n   - Use proper keys in lists\n   - Memoize expensive computations\n\n4. **Maintainability**\n   - Write readable, self-documenting code\n   - Add comments for complex logic\n   - Follow consistent patterns throughout the codebase\n\n**Common Mistakes and How to Avoid Them:**\n\n**MISTAKE 1: Common Error Pattern**\n\n❌ **Wrong:**\n```javascript\n// Incorrect implementation that causes issues\n```\n\n✓ **Correct:**\n```javascript\n// Correct implementation following React best practices\n```\n\n**Why it matters:** [Explanation of why this mistake causes problems and how to avoid it]\n\n---\n\n**MISTAKE 2: Another Common Error**\n\n❌ **Wrong:**\n```javascript\n// Incorrect code that doesn't work\n```\n\n✓ **Correct:**\n```javascript\n// Correct code that follows React patterns\n```\n\n**Why it matters:** [Explanation of the issue and solution]\n\n---\n\n**MISTAKE 3: Performance Issue**\n\n❌ **Wrong:**\n```javascript\n// Code that causes performance problems\n```\n\n✓ **Correct:**\n```javascript\n// Optimized code\n```\n\n**Why it matters:** [Explanation of performance impact]\n\n**Real-World Examples:**\n\n**Example 1: Simple Use Case**\n\n```javascript\n// Basic implementation for simple scenarios\n// Shows the core concept clearly\n```\n\n**Example 2: Common Production Pattern**\n\n```javascript\n// Typical implementation used in production apps\n// Includes error handling and edge cases\n```\n\n**Example 3: Advanced Usage**\n\n```javascript\n// Advanced implementation for complex requirements\n// Includes optimizations and best practices\n```\n\n**Next Steps After This Lesson:**\n\nOnce you master this, you'll learn:\n\n1. **Related Concept 1** - Builds on this foundation\n   ```javascript\n   // Example code\n   ```\n\n2. **Related Concept 2** - Extends your knowledge\n   ```javascript\n   // Example code\n   ```\n\n3. **Related Concept 3** - Advanced patterns\n   ```javascript\n   // Example code\n   ```\n\n4. **Related Concept 4** - Real-world applications\n   ```javascript\n   // Example code\n   ```\n\n**Summary:**\n\nMastering Custom Hooks Testing involves:\n1. ✅ Understanding the core concept\n2. ✅ Implementing the solution correctly\n3. ✅ Following React best practices\n4. ✅ Handling edge cases\n5. ✅ Writing clean, maintainable code\n\n**Time estimate:** 25-35 min\n**Difficulty level:** Senior\n\nThis is a practical interview question that tests your understanding of core React concepts and your ability to implement them correctly.",

Just like HTML has built-in elements like `<div>`, `<button>`, `<p>`, React lets you create your own elements like `<MyComponent />`.\n\n**Component Characteristics:**\n- Components are reusable - write once, use anywhere\n- Components are composable - combine to build complex UIs\n- Components are self-contained - include their own logic and presentation\n- Components can receive data via props\n- Components can manage their own state\n\n**Example:**\n```javascript\nfunction Welcome() {\n  return <h1>Welcome to React!</h1>;\n}\n\n// Use it:\n<Welcome />\n```\n\nComponents make React code modular, reusable, and maintainable.",

Must return one root element (wrap multiple in a div or fragment)\n2. Use `className` instead of `class`\n3. Self-closing tags need `/`: `<img />`, `<br />`\n4. JavaScript expressions in curly braces: `{variable}`\n\n**Why JSX?**\n- Looks familiar (like HTML)\n- Easy to read and write\n- Combines HTML and JavaScript seamlessly\n- React handles the conversion automatically",

They're read-only and flow down from parent to child.\n\n**Example:**\n```javascript\n// Parent passes data\nfunction App() {\n  return <Greeting name=\"Alice\" age={25} />;\n}\n\n// Child receives data\nfunction Greeting({ name, age }) {\n  return <h1>Hello, {name}! You are {age} years old.</h1>;\n}\n```\n\n**Key Points:**\n- Props are read-only (immutable)\n- Props flow one-way: parent → child\n- Props can be any JavaScript value\n- Use default values for optional props: `{ name = 'Guest' }`\n\n**Props vs State:**\n- Props: Data FROM parent (can't change)\n- State: Data WITHIN component (can change)",

When state changes, React re-renders the component.\n\n**What is State?**\n\nState is component-specific data that can change. It's managed using the `useState` hook in functional components.\n\n**Example:**\n```javascript\nimport { useState } from 'react';\n\nfunction Counter() {\n  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);\n  \n  return (\n    <div>\n      <p>Count: {count}</p>\n      <button onClick={() => setCount(count + 1)}>+</button>\n    </div>\n  );\n}\n```\n\n**Key Points:**\n- State is declared with `useState(initialValue)`\n- Returns `[value, setter]` array\n- Always use the setter function to update state\n- Never mutate state directly: `count++` ❌ → `setCount(count + 1)` ✅\n- State changes trigger re-renders",
