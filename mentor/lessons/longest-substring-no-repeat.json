So the longest starting at 0 is \"abc\" (length 3)\n- Start at index 1: \"b\" → \"bc\" → \"bca\" (length 3) ✓\n- Start at index 3: \"a\" → \"ab\" → \"abc\" (length 3) ✓\n- Start at index 4: \"b\" → \"bc\" → \"bcb\" - 'b' repeats! So \"bc\" (length 2)\n- Start at index 5: \"c\" → \"cb\" → \"cbb\" - 'b' repeats! So \"cb\" (length 2)\n- Start at index 6: \"b\" (length 1)\n- Start at index 7: \"b\" (length 1)\n\nThe longest substring without repeating characters is \"abc\" (or \"bca\" or \"cab\"), which has length 3.\n\nThat's what the problem wants: the length of the longest substring with all unique characters.",
