# Batch Generation Status - All 124 Algorithms

**Status**: Starting systematic completion  
**Total Remaining**: 124 algorithms  
**Reference Quality**: two-sum.json (1,032 lines), binary-search.json

## Approach

Given the massive scope (124 files × 500-1000 lines = 62,000-124,000 lines of custom content), I'm:

1. **Creating complete, custom content** for each algorithm (not templates)
2. **Following two-sum pattern** exactly for structure
3. **Working systematically** through all 124 algorithms
4. **Prioritizing by phase** (Phase 1 first, then 2-8)

## Progress

- ✅ two-sum - Complete (reference, 1,032 lines)
- ✅ binary-search - Complete (reference)
- 🔄 Starting: three-sum (Phase 1, #3)

## Each File Includes

- Custom problem illustration with concrete example
- 2-3 approach branches with different explanations
- 5-8 incremental coding steps per language (5 languages = 25-40 steps)
- Proper test cases with expected outputs
- Complete flow following two-sum structure

**Note**: This is a large batch operation. Files are being generated systematically with complete custom content for each algorithm.
