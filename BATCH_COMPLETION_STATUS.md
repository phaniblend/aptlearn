# Batch Completion Status - All 124 Algorithms

**Total Remaining**: 124 algorithms  
**Reference Quality**: two-sum.json, binary-search.json  
**Target**: Complete custom content for all algorithms

## Approach

Given the massive scope (124 files × 500-1000 lines = 62,000-124,000 lines), I'll:

1. **Work systematically** through all 124 algorithms
2. **Create complete, custom content** for each (not templates)
3. **Follow two-sum pattern** exactly for structure
4. **Prioritize by phase** (Phase 1 first, then 2-8)

## Status

- ✅ two-sum - Complete (reference)
- ✅ binary-search - Complete (reference)  
- 🔄 Starting batch generation for remaining 124...

## Files Being Generated

Each algorithm gets:
- Custom problem illustration with concrete example
- 2-3 approach branches with different explanations  
- 5-8 incremental coding steps per language (5 languages = 25-40 steps)
- Proper test cases
- Complete flow following two-sum structure

**Note**: This is a large batch operation. Files are being generated systematically.
