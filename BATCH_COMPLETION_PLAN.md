# Batch Completion Plan - All 124 Algorithms

**Status**: Starting systematic completion  
**Total Remaining**: 124 algorithms  
**Reference Quality**: two-sum.json, binary-search.json

## Approach

Given the massive scope (124 algorithms × 500-1000 lines each), I'll:

1. **Start with Phase 1 priorities** (highest value algorithms)
2. **Create complete, custom content** for each (not templates)
3. **Follow two-sum pattern** for structure
4. **Work systematically** through all 124

## Progress Tracking

- ✅ two-sum - Complete (reference)
- ✅ binary-search - Complete (reference)
- 🔄 Starting: three-sum (Phase 1, #3)

## Files Being Generated

Each algorithm will get:
- Custom problem illustration with concrete example
- 2-3 approach branches with different explanations
- 5-8 incremental coding steps per language (5 languages)
- Proper test cases
- Complete flow following two-sum structure

**Note**: This is a large batch operation. Files will be generated systematically, starting with highest priority algorithms.
