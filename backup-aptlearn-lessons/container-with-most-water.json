Here's the core idea:\n\n1. **Start with widest container**: Initialize left = 0, right = n-1\n2. **Calculate area**: Area = (right - left) × min(height[left], height[right])\n3. **Move the shorter pointer**: Always move the pointer pointing to the shorter line\n4. **Track maximum**: Keep track of the maximum area seen so far\n\n**Why move the shorter pointer?**\n- If we move the taller pointer, the width decreases and the height can't increase (limited by the shorter line)\n- If we move the shorter pointer, the width decreases but the height might increase\n- So moving the shorter pointer gives us a chance to find a better area\n\nLet's trace this with [1, 8, 6, 2, 5, 4, 8, 3, 7]:\n\n- **Initial**: left = 0 (height=1), right = 8 (height=7), maxArea = 0\n  - Area = (8-0) × min(1,7) = 8 × 1 = 8, maxArea = 8\n  - Move left (shorter)\n- **left = 1, right = 8**: height[left]=8, height[right]=7\n  - Area = (8-1) × min(8,7) = 7 × 7 = 49, maxArea = 49\n  - Move right (shorter)\n- **left = 1, right = 7**: height[left]=8, height[right]=3\n  - Area = (7-1) × min(8,3) = 6 × 3 = 18, maxArea = 49\n  - Move right (shorter)\n- Continue until left >= right\n\nThis is O(n) time and O(1) space!
