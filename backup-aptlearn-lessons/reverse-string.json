Now let's understand what the Reverse String problem is asking.\n\nImagine you have a string: \"hello\"\n\nYour task: Reverse it to become \"olleh\".\n\nLooking at the string:\n- Original: h-e-l-l-o (indices 0, 1, 2, 3, 4)\n- Reversed: o-l-l-e-h (indices 4, 3, 2, 1, 0)\n\nNotice:\n- The first character 'h' (index 0) becomes the last character\n- The last character 'o' (index 4) becomes the first character\n- The middle character 'l' (index 2) stays in the middle\n\nAnother example: \"world\"\n- Original: w-o-r-l-d\n- Reversed: d-l-r-o-w\n\nThat's what the problem wants: reverse the order of characters in the string. We typically do this in-place (modify the original string/array).",
