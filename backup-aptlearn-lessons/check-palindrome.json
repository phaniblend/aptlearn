Now let's understand what the Check Palindrome problem is asking.\n\nA palindrome is a word, phrase, or sequence that reads the same forwards and backwards.\n\n**Visual Example with \"racecar\":**\n\nForward:  r → a → c → e → c → a → r\nBackward: r ← a ← c ← e ← c ← a ← r\n\nThey match! ✓ It's a palindrome!\n\n**Visual Example with \"hello\":**\n\nForward:  h → e → l → l → o\nBackward: o ← l ← l ← e ← h\n\nThey don't match! ✗ Not a palindrome.\n\n**For arrays/strings, we check character by character:**\n\nExample: [1, 2, 3, 2, 1]\n- Index 0 (1) should match index 4 (1) ✓\n- Index 1 (2) should match index 3 (2) ✓\n- Index 2 (3) is in the middle, no match needed ✓\n\nAll pairs match! This is a palindrome!\n\n**Key Insight**: We can use two pointers - one starting from the left (beginning) and one from the right (end). We compare characters at both pointers and move them inward until they meet.\n\nThat's what the problem wants: check if a string or array reads the same forwards and backwards.",

Here's the core idea:\n\n1. **Two pointers**: One starts at the beginning (left = 0), one at the end (right = length - 1)\n2. **Compare**: Check if characters at both pointers match\n3. **Move inward**: If they match, move left pointer right (left++), right pointer left (right--)\n4. **Early exit**: If they don't match, return false immediately\n5. **Stop condition**: Stop when left >= right (pointers meet or cross)\n\nLet's trace this step-by-step with \"racecar\" (length 7):\n\n**Initial**: left = 0, right = 6\n  - s[0] = 'r', s[6] = 'r'\n  - 'r' == 'r'? ✓ Match! Continue\n  - left = 1, right = 5\n\n**Step 1**: left = 1, right = 5\n  - s[1] = 'a', s[5] = 'a'\n  - 'a' == 'a'? ✓ Match! Continue\n  - left = 2, right = 4\n\n**Step 2**: left = 2, right = 4\n  - s[2] = 'c', s[4] = 'c'\n  - 'c' == 'c'? ✓ Match! Continue\n  - left = 3, right = 3\n\n**Step 3**: left = 3, right = 3\n  - left >= right? Yes! Stop\n  - All characters matched! ✓\n\n**Result**: It's a palindrome!\n\nNow let's trace \"hello\" (length 5):\n\n**Initial**: left = 0, right = 4\n  - s[0] = 'h', s[4] = 'o'\n  - 'h' == 'o'? ✗ Don't match!\n  - Return false immediately\n\n**Result**: Not a palindrome\n\n**Time Complexity**: O(n) - we visit each character at most once\n**Space Complexity**: O(1) - we only use two pointers\n\nThis is very efficient!
