Now let's understand what Selection Sort does.\n\nImagine you have an unsorted array: [5, 2, 8, 1, 9]\n\nYour task: Sort it in ascending order (smallest to largest).\n\nSelection sort works by repeatedly finding the minimum element in the unsorted portion and swapping it with the first element of the unsorted portion.\n\nLet's trace through the algorithm:\n\n**Initial**: [5, 2, 8, 1, 9]\n- Unsorted portion: indices 0-4\n- Find minimum: index 3 (value 1)\n- Swap with index 0 → [1, 2, 8, 5, 9]\n\n**After iteration 1**: [1, 2, 8, 5, 9]\n- Sorted: [1]\n- Unsorted portion: indices 1-4\n- Find minimum: index 1 (value 2, already in place)\n- No swap needed → [1, 2, 8, 5, 9]\n\n**After iteration 2**: [1, 2, 8, 5, 9]\n- Sorted: [1, 2]\n- Unsorted portion: indices 2-4\n- Find minimum: index 3 (value 5)\n- Swap with index 2 → [1, 2, 5, 8, 9]\n\n**After iteration 3**: [1, 2, 5, 8, 9]\n- Sorted: [1, 2, 5]\n- Unsorted portion: indices 3-4\n- Find minimum: index 3 (value 8, already in place)\n- No swap needed → [1, 2, 5, 8, 9]\n\n**Final**: [1, 2, 5, 8, 9] (sorted!)\n\nEach iteration places the next smallest element in its correct position.",
