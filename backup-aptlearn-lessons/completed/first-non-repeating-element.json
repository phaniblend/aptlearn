Now let's understand what the Find First Non-Repeating Element problem is asking.\n\nImagine you have an array of numbers: [9, 4, 9, 6, 7, 4]\n\nYour task: Find the first element that appears only once (doesn't repeat) in the array.\n\nLooking at the array from left to right:\n- 9 appears at index 0, then again at index 2 → This repeats!\n- 4 appears at index 1, then again at index 5 → This repeats!\n- 6 appears only at index 3 → This doesn't repeat!\n- 7 appears only at index 4 → This doesn't repeat!\n\nBut which one is the FIRST non-repeating element? We need to find which element appears only once and comes first in the array.\n\n- 6 first appears at index 3\n- 7 first appears at index 4\n\nSince 6 appears earlier (index 3) than 7 (index 4), 6 is the first non-repeating element.\n\nThat's what the problem wants: the first element in the array that appears exactly once.",

This is non-repeating!\n- At index 4 (7): Check rest of array → Not found! This is also non-repeating!\n\nSince 6 appears first (index 3 < index 4), 6 is the answer.\n\nThis definitely works!
