Now let's understand what the Remove Duplicates from Unsorted Array problem is asking.\n\nImagine you have an unsorted array: [3, 1, 2, 3, 2, 1]\n\nYour task: Remove all duplicate values, keeping only unique elements.\n\nLooking at the array:\n- 3 appears twice (at index 0 and 3)\n- 1 appears twice (at index 1 and 5)\n- 2 appears twice (at index 2 and 4)\n\nAfter removing duplicates, we want: [3, 1, 2]\n\nNotice: We keep the first occurrence of each unique value. The order of unique elements is preserved based on their first appearance.\n\nThat's what the problem wants: remove all duplicate values from an unsorted array, keeping only the first occurrence of each unique value.",

However, sorting changes the original order. If we need to preserve the order of first occurrence, we'd need to track original indices, which adds complexity.\n\nThere's a simpler O(n) approach using a hash set that preserves order.
