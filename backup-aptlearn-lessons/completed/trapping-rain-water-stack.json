Now let's understand the Trapping Rain Water problem using a stack approach.\n\nWe have the same problem: height = [0, 1, 0, 2, 1, 0, 1, 3, 2, 1, 2, 1]\n\nVisual representation:\n         |\n    |    |  |\n| _ |  | | | |\n0 1 0 2 1 0 1 3 2 1 2 1\n\n**Stack Approach Insight**:\nWe use a stack to store indices of bars in decreasing order of height. When we find a bar taller than the bar at the top of the stack, we can calculate the water trapped between them.\n\n**Key Idea**:\n- Stack stores indices of bars with decreasing heights\n- When we see a bar taller than stack top, we can trap water\n- Water trapped = (current index - stack top index - 1) * (min(height[current], height[stack top]) - height[stack top])\n\nLet's trace:\n- Process index 0 (height=0): stack = [0]\n- Process index 1 (height=1): height[1] > height[0], pop 0, calculate water\n- Process index 2 (height=0): stack = [1, 2]\n- Process index 3 (height=2): height[3] > height[2], pop and calculate water\n- Continue...\n\nThis approach processes each bar once, making it O(n) time with O(n) space for the stack.",
