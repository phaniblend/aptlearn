You have 2 baskets, and each basket can only hold one type of fruit.\n\nYour task: Find the maximum number of fruits you can collect (pick fruits from a contiguous subarray) such that you have at most 2 different types of fruits.\n\nLet's explore:\n- Start at index 0: [1] → 1 type, count = 1\n- Continue to index 1: [1, 2] → 2 types, count = 2\n- Continue to index 2: [1, 2, 1] → 2 types, count = 3 ✓\n\nMaximum: 3 fruits\n\n**Key Insight**: This is the same as \"Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters\" where K = 2!\n\nWe use a sliding window with a hash map to track fruit types. We expand the window until we have more than 2 types, then shrink it from the left.\n\nThat's what the problem wants: the maximum number of fruits you can collect with at most 2 different types.",
